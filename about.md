Welcome to PDX Data Science
===========

We're all about openness. We bring together a range of Meetups that are part of the larger data science conversation in Portland. This site collects links to all the talks (and data!) from recent events. 

The initial members of this Meetup Consortium are:

* [Portland Data Science Group](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/)
* [Portland Data User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-User-Group/)
* [PDX Data Engineering](http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Data-Engineering/)
