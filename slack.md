Do you want to keep up with the conversation between our various meetups? We use [Slack](www.slack.com), a powerful group communication tool.

Conversations in Slack are organized into channels but you can also send messages privately. Everyone is automatically added to the **#general** channel, but there are others you might want to follow. 

Notifications are highly configurableâ€”so you can make sure you see the important stuff as soon as you need to without being distracted by the rest. You can customize your notification settings for any channel, depending on how actively you want to keep up with that conversation.
