We are trying to organize a career fair for PDX Data Science.  As a first step we are trying to ascertain whether or not there are enough people interested in attending such an event and so we are asking  people to fill out this [two minute survey](https://goo.gl/forms/GachZMENgEpdQrrk1).

Additional information about the Career Fair will be available on [http://pdxdata.org](http://pdxdata.org) and on the [#careerfair](https://pdxdata.slack.com/messages/careerfair/details/) channel on Slack. If you have not done so before, you are welcome to join our Slack team, PdxData,  by inviting yourself here: [http://pdxdata.org/slack](http://pdxdata.org/slack)
