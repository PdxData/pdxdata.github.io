Satish Doguparthy talked about analytics using R for optimizing tens of thousands of wireless plans for Internet of Things devices.  

Opportunities are in Plain Sight… the challenge is Business Engagement and Justification …

Insights in Satish' conclusion were:

* The more you look at the data, the more insights you find
* It’s not easy to make people believe you; it takes time to engage with business partners
* Interactive analytics products (e.g., Shiny apps) are more useful than sharing static charts
* more time goes into data gathering, data cleaning and understanding the data than into analysis
* Important to change the mindset around data analysis
  * from: we take the order from our business partners and deliver
  * to: we explore the possibilities and insights with our partners
