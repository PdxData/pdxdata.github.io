Real-world business data systems are often a mess. With customer and other data spread across multiple silos and complex technology stacks, it can be very difficult to get a complete picture of how data can fulfill the needs an organization has. With different teams (IT, marketing, executives, etc.) having divergent needs, it can get even messier. Tonight we are going to talk about some of the foibles faced by organizations, and ways to overcome them.
