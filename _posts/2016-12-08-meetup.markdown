Let's have a Shiny night! If you're not familiar with Shiny, check it out at [http://shiny.rstudio.com](http://shiny.rstudio.com) - Shiny is a web application framework for R. Many people use Shiny to convey business/research/etc. findings to collaborators/bosses/etc. without needing the person to be able to code. Checkout [https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery) to see some really cool examples. 

We're going to have a brief tutorial for those that haven't used Shiny, as well as some Shiny use cases to see what you can do with Shiny in the real world.
